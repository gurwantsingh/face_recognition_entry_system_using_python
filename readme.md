#Face Recognition Entry System for Private Parties

Welcome to the Face Recognition Entry System project! This Python-based application is designed to provide secure and efficient access control for private parties and events using facial recognition technology.

#Features

Real-time Face Recognition: The system uses live video feeds to recognize and authenticate faces for event entry.

User Registration: Add and store faces of authorized individuals who can enter the event.

Access Control: Only registered faces are granted access, ensuring a secure entry process.

Simple Interface: Easy-to-use interface for managing authorized users.

Customizable: Can be adapted for different event sizes and requirements.

#Technologies Used

Python: The main programming language for developing the system.

OpenCV: A library used for real-time computer vision tasks like capturing video and detecting faces.

face_recognition: A Python library that simplifies the process of recognizing and manipulating faces in images and videos.

Tkinter (optional, if applicable): For creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage the system.

#Installation

Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

Steps to Install Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash Copy git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-entry-system.git Navigate to the project directory:

bash Copy cd face-recognition-entry-system Install the required dependencies:

bash Copy pip install -r requirements.txt Usage Register New Faces:

Run the script to capture images of authorized individuals and register their faces in the system.

Start the Entry System:

Once the faces are registered, launch the entry system which will continuously monitor for registered faces and grant access accordingly.

Example command to start the system:

bash Copy python entry_system.py Face Recognition Process:

The system will begin capturing video and attempting to match faces to the registered users.

If an authorized face is detected, access is granted.

Future Enhancements Integration with a database to store and manage large sets of registered faces.

Alerts or notifications for unauthorized access attempts.

More advanced user interface for managing faces and events.

Support for additional security features like event check-in logs.
